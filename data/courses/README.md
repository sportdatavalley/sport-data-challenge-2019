# Explanation of course data

This directory contains .tcx files for the main distance of each event:
- TCS Amsterdam Marathon: marathon
- Dam tot Damloop: 10 mile
- NN Egmond Halve Marathon: half marathon
- Groet uit Schoorl Run: 30km

*Please note that there is also course data available in the dataset from Le Champion.*

The provided files are not the official tracks for the races but are generated by finding the most recent or accurate [Strava](https://www.strava.com) segment, creating a route from that and exporting that route as a .tcx file.
Therefore, the total distance and altitude might not be completely correct.
For simple mapping purposes and to do some analyses on the altitude profiles the data might suffice.
Although .tcx files are .xml files, it is easier to work with .csv files, so we also provided a conversion to .csv file for each course.
